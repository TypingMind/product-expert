### Add Custom Model: Deep Dive for Pro Users

This section delves into the technical aspects of the "Add Custom Model" feature, providing insights for advanced users who want to understand how TypingMind interacts with their custom models and how to troubleshoot potential issues.

### How TypingMind Communicates with Custom Models

- **Direct Client-Side Communication:** TypingMind establishes a *direct* connection from the user's browser (client-side) to the API endpoint of your custom model. This means that:
    - **Data Privacy:** Your data (prompts, conversation history) is sent directly to *your* model's endpoint and doesn't pass through TypingMind's servers (unless you are using cloud sync).
    - **Latency:** The latency is dependent on the network connection between the user's browser and your model's server. TypingMind adds minimal overhead to this communication.
    - **Security:** TypingMind relies on your custom model's API endpoint to handle security and authentication. Ensure your endpoint is properly secured with HTTPS and appropriate authentication mechanisms.
- **`v1/chat/completions` API Compliance:** For "OpenAI Compatible API" models, TypingMind expects the custom model to adhere to OpenAI's `v1/chat/completions` API specification. This includes:
    - **Request Structure:** TypingMind sends requests with a structure that matches OpenAI's API, including parameters like `messages` (an array of conversation turns with `role` and `content`), `temperature`, `top_p`, `n`, `stream`, etc.
    - **Response Format:** TypingMind expects responses to be in the format defined by OpenAI's API, typically a JSON object containing a `choices` array with the model's generated `text`.
    - **Streaming:** If `Support Streaming Output` is enabled, TypingMind expects the API to send Server-Sent Events (SSE) with the `data` field containing JSON chunks of the response.
- **Custom Headers & Body Parameters:** These features allow you to tailor the requests sent to your custom model's API:
    - **Headers:** Useful for authentication (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `X-API-Key: your_api_key`), content type specification (`Content-Type: application/json`), or custom tracking.
    - **Body Parameters:** Useful for passing additional data or instructions to your model that are not part of the standard OpenAI API.

### Common Questions & Troubleshooting Guide

**Q: My custom model is not working. What should I do?**

1. **Verify the Endpoint URL:** Double-check that the endpoint URL is correct and that the API is running and accessible. Use tools like `curl` or `Postman` to test the endpoint directly.
2. **Check the API Type:** Ensure that you have selected the correct API Type ("OpenAI Compatible API" for OpenAI-like models).
3. **Review Custom Headers & Body Parameters:** Make sure that any custom headers or body parameters are correctly configured. Typos or incorrect values can cause API requests to fail.
4. **Inspect the Request/Response:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual requests being sent to your custom model and the responses being returned. Look for any error messages or unexpected data.
5. **Examine the Model's Logs:** Check your custom model's logs for any errors or exceptions that might be occurring. This can provide valuable insights into what's going wrong.
6. **Confirm API Compliance:** For "OpenAI Compatible API" models, make sure that your API adheres to the OpenAI `v1/chat/completions` API specification.
7. **Context Length:** If your model is cutting off responses, ensure that the context length is set appropriately.
8. **Rate Limiting:** Check if your custom model has rate limiting enabled. If so, TypingMind might be exceeding the limits.

**Q: How can I troubleshoot authentication issues?**

1. **Verify API Keys/Tokens:** Double-check that your API keys or authentication tokens are correct and have the necessary permissions.
2. **Inspect Headers:** Use browser developer tools to confirm that the `Authorization` header or other authentication-related headers are being sent correctly with the request.
3. **Check Server Logs:** Review your custom model's server logs for any authentication errors.

**Q: The streamed responses are garbled or incomplete. What could be the issue?**

1. **SSE Compliance:** Ensure that your API is sending valid Server-Sent Events (SSE) with the `data` field containing JSON chunks of the response.
2. **Encoding:** Make sure that the responses are properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8).
3. **Buffering:** Check if your API is buffering the output before sending it. This can cause delays and incomplete responses.
4. **Network Issues:** Investigate potential network issues that might be interrupting the stream.

**Q: How can I estimate the cost of using my custom model?**

1. **Token Usage:** Accurately estimate the number of input and output tokens used per conversation.
2. **Pricing Information:** Obtain the cost per 1 million input tokens and the cost per 1 million output tokens from your custom model provider.
3. **Manual Calculation:** Multiply the number of tokens by the cost per token to estimate the total cost.
4. **TypingMind Integration:** Enter the price information into the "Price for Cost Estimation" fields in TypingMind. This will allow TypingMind to provide cost estimates within the chat interface.

**Q: My model supports OpenAI Functions (plugins). How do I enable them in TypingMind?**

1. **Enable the Toggle:** Set the "Support Plugins (via OpenAI Functions)" toggle to "On" when adding or editing the model.
2. **Function Schema:** Ensure that your model's API is able to interpret the "functions" or "tool_calls" parameter in the request and that it returns the correct function call information in the response.
3. **Plugin Configuration:** Configure the plugins you want to use in TypingMind's plugin management interface.

By understanding these technical details and troubleshooting tips, you can effectively integrate and utilize your custom models within TypingMind, unlocking the full potential of your AI creations.

<PROMPT_CACHING_FEATURE>
## Prompt Caching Feature

The Prompt Caching feature in TypingMind is designed to optimize token usage and reduce API costs by storing and reusing the results of frequently used prompts. When enabled, TypingMind caches the AI's responses to specific prompts, allowing subsequent requests for the same prompts to be served from the cache instead of being reprocessed by the AI model.

### Key Benefits

*   **Reduced Token Usage:** By serving responses from the cache, TypingMind can significantly reduce the number of tokens consumed, resulting in lower API costs.
*   **Faster Response Times:** Cached responses are served instantly, eliminating the need to wait for the AI model to generate a new response.
*   **Improved Performance:** By reducing the load on the AI model, prompt caching can improve overall application performance and responsiveness.

### Enabling Prompt Caching
Prompt caching is enabled on a per-model basis:
1. **Access the Model Settings:**
    * There are two ways to access the model parameters settings:
        * Refer to the instructions described on "Accessing Model Parameter Settings" section on `<MODEL_PARAMETERS_SETTINGS>`.
2. **Override Global Model Parameters:** Ensure that the "Override Global Model Parameters" toggle switch is enabled.
3. **Locate the "Prompt Caching" Toggle Switch:** Scroll down to the "Prompt Caching" section.
4. **Enable Prompt Caching:** Click the toggle switch to enable prompt caching for the selected model.
    * **Enabled State:** When the toggle is switched to the right, it is typically displayed with a blue color.
    * **Disabled State:** When the toggle is switched to the left, it is typically displayed in gray.
5. **Considerations**:
    * A message show up: `Prompt caching helps save token costs for long conversations. Enabling this will incur additional tokens when initiating the cache for the first time, but it can save many more tokens later, especially for long conversations. Not all models support caching, and some models require a minimum number of tokens for caching to be initiated. Please check with your AI model provider for more information.`

### Prompt Caching behavior

*   When enabled, it store all AI response content to cache. The new user prompt will look for similar content to the new prompt, if there is any, the older content will show up.

### Chat Info: Prompt Caching Status

The "Chat Info" dialog provides information about the prompt caching status in the current chat.
1.  **Accessing the Chat Info Dialog:** In the chat interface, locate the cost display at the top right corner, or in the 3-dots `More Options` button then click on "Chat Info". This will open the Chat Info popup window.
2.  **Locate the "Total Tokens Cached" Field:**
    *It's in the 4th section of the dialog
3.  **Status Indicator:** The "Total Tokens Cached" field displays the following information:
    *   **Cached information:** It will show the tokens cached for the chat.
    *  If it is caching for the first time, it show (Inactive), and a note show, saying `Caching is supported but not yet activated for this chat. Some models requires a minimum number of tokens to be used before caching is activated.`

### Additional Details

*   The total tokens cached is also displayed in the chat info dialog
*   Not all models support caching.
*   Some models require a minimum number of tokens for caching to be initiated.
*   If you're in a chat session, and you switch to a different model, then the data won't get cached, even though `prompt caching` is turned on in the settings. Caching will apply only when the AI assistant starts from scratch.

**Important Notes:**

- The "Get API key here" links are crucial, as they direct users to the correct pages on each provider's website to obtain their API keys.
- The workflow is very similar for all API key types. The main difference is the specific provider's website where the key is obtained.
- The placeholder text in each input field gives a hint about the expected format of the key.
- Always check the API key after entering it to ensure it's working correctly.
- Admins do not need to fill in all of the API keys, but need to fill in at least one API Key for models (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google Gemini) to make the chat portal work.

    - **Input Type:** Toggle switch.
- **Run this plugin with user's own settings Toggle:**
    - **Purpose:** Determines whether the plugin uses the settings (like API keys) provided by the administrator in this panel, or if it requires each user to provide their own settings in their individual TypingMind interface.
    - **Input Type:** Toggle switch.
    - **Disabled State (Default - Uses Admin-Provided Settings):**
        - The plugin relies on the API keys or other settings configured by the administrator in the "Plugin Settings Section" below.
        - Execution typically happens server-side for security and consistency.
        - User credentials (API keys, etc.) are *not* exposed to the end-user.
        - This is generally the preferred mode for team environments, as admins manage credentials centrally.
    - **Enabled State (Requires User-Provided Settings):**
        - The plugin configuration fields (like API keys) in the *admin panel* are hidden or disabled for this plugin.
        - A yellow label "Use user-provided settings" appears next to the plugin name in the main list.
        - **End-users will be required** to go to their own plugin settings interface (if the plugin manager UI is shown to them) and enter their *personal* API keys or credentials for this specific plugin before they can use it.
        - Plugin execution might happen in the user's browser (client-side) depending on the plugin's implementation, especially for plugins requiring user-specific authentication or interaction.
        - **Use Case:** Useful when you want individual users to utilize their own personal API keys/accounts for certain services, potentially for tracking individual usage or costs on external platforms, or for plugins designed to run locally in the browser.
    - **"Learn more" Link:** Provides additional documentation about this setting.
- **Plugin Settings Section (Conditional):**
    - **Visibility:** This section (containing fields for API keys, IDs, etc.) is typically visible and editable only when the plugin is configured to use **Admin-Provided Settings** (i.e., "Run this plugin with user's own settings" is OFF).
    - **Content:** Contains the specific configuration fields required by the plugin (e.g., "Search Engine ID," "Search Engine API Key" for Web Search; "Alpha Vantage API Key" for Market News). Admins enter the *centralized* credentials here.
    - **"Save" Button:** Saves the entered settings for admin-provided configuration.
- **Plugin Description/Usage Section:** Provides information about the plugin's purpose, how it works, any API key requirements, and example usage prompts.

### Admin-Provided vs. User-Provided Settings Summary

- **Admin-Provided Settings (Default):**
    - Admin configures API keys/settings centrally in the Admin Panel.
    - the plugin sends HTTP requests to external servers, these requests are sent from the TypingMind server, keeping them hidden from the user.
    - Credentials hidden from users.
    - Simpler for users (no setup needed).
    - Recommended for most team scenarios.
- **User-Provided Settings (Optional):**
    - Enabled via "Run this plugin with user's own settings" toggle.
    - Admin *does not* provide central API keys for this plugin in the Admin Panel.
    - Users *must* provide their own API keys/settings in their own interface.
    - Execution might occur in the user's browser depending on the plugin.
    - Users will not see your plugin source on the chat interface

### Important Considerations

- All plugins are now run on server side to ensure maximum security.
- You can allow your users to add their own settings for plugins, but they will not see your plugin source on the chat interface

### Plugin References

- Refer to <PLUGINS_FEATURE_DEEP_DIVE> to get more information about Plugins and Plugin setups.
- Refer to <DEVELOP_CUSTOM_PLUGINS> for get more information on how to build a custom plugins.

## Settings Tab

There are two options for Knowledge Base settings in the toggle button:

- Only use knowledge base data for AI agents: By default, training data will be used for all chats across all models. If you enable this option, the training data will only be used when using with AI agents. Chats with base models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.) will not have access to training data. You can set the AI agents to have access to a subset of the training data by updating the knowledge base preference in the AI agent settings
- Show reference sources of training documents to users: By default, the sources of the training documents are not visible to users. If you enable this option, the response messages will include links to the document sources. Please note that the users may be able to download the original file if it is available.

### How Knowledge Base works

The AI assistant gets the data from uploaded files via a vector database. Here is how the files are processed:

1. Files/Data are connected
2. We extract the raw text from the files and try our best to preserve the meaningful context of the file.
3. We split the text into chunks. The chunks are separated and split in a way that preserves the meaningful context of the document. (Note that the chunk size may change in the future, that’s why we do not indicate the size as it will continuously update and improve)
4. These chunks are stored in a database.
5. When your users send a chat message, the system will try to retrieve up to **5 relevant chunks** from the database (based on the content of the chat so far) and provide that as a context to the AI assistant via the system message. This means the AI assistant will have access to the 5 most relevant chunks of uploaded data at all time during a chat.
6. The “relevantness” of the chunks is decided by our system and we are improving this with every update of the system.
7. The AI assistant will rely on the provided text chunks from the system message to provide the best answer to the user.

All of your uploaded files are stored securely on our system. We never share your data to anyone else without informing you beforehand.

### **Best practices to provide knowledge base**

1. Use raw text in [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format if you can. LLM model understands markdown very well and can make sense of the content much more efficient compare to PDFs, DOCX, etc.
2. Use both Upload Files/Data Connection and [**System Prompts**](https://docs.typingmind.com/typingmind-custom/branding-and-customizations/system-prompts-on-admin-panel). A combination of a well-prompted system instruction and a clean knowledge base is proven to have the best result for the end users.

### System Prompts Interface Overview

The System Prompts interface is designed to provide a clear and organized way to manage different types of global prompts. It includes the following key elements:

- **Page Title:** System Prompts
- **Page Description:** Set global system instructions and related prompts.

The interface is organized into distinct sections for different types of prompts:

### 1. Global System Instruction

- **Purpose:** Defines the overarching system prompt that will be applied to all chats and AI agents within the chat instance. This prompt sets the foundation for the AI's behavior, personality, and response style.
- **Description:** "This is the system prompt for the whole chat instance and will be used in all chats and AI agents. Check 'Examples' to see some examples of training instructions. Your users will not see this data."
- **Input Type:** Text area (multi-line text field).
    - The text area supports multi-line input.
    - The text area has a light-gray background.
    - The text color in the text area is black.
    - A character counter is displayed on the right side of the text area.
- **Example Content:** Provides example text for setting initial instruction with system variables, and the prompts can include:
    - `You are a helpful AI assistant. Today is {local_date}, local time is {local_time}.`

### 2. Global Few-shot Prompting

- **Purpose:** Provides a way to include few-shot examples that will be prepended to *every* conversation. These examples demonstrate to the AI *how* to respond, promoting a desired output style, format, or tone.
- **Description:** "Few-shot prompting is a technique to help the AI agent learn how to respond to users in a specific way by providing demonstrations in the prompt to steer the model toward better performance. The prompts will be automatically inserted at the beginning of every conversation, right after the system instructions (but not included in the system instruction). This is useful when you want the AI to always respond in a very specific format. Your users will not see the prompts you entered here."
- **"+ Add New Prompt" Button:** Clicking this button adds a new few-shot example entry.
- **Few-shot Example Entry:** Each entry consists of two text areas:
    - **User Message:** Simulates a user input. This is the "example question."
    - **Assistant Response:** Simulates the desired AI response. This is the "example answer."
    - **Remove button:** Remove the current few-shot entry.
- Example can be something like:
    - **User Message:** "Can you help create a marketing plan for Q4."
    - **Assistant Response:**
        
        Here's your plan:
        ...
        
- Few-shot examples allow for greater control and predictability in AI behaviors.

### 3. Global Post-Message Reminder

- **Purpose:** Appends a reminder to *every* user message. This reminder is *only* visible to the AI assistant and is intended to influence its behavior without the user explicitly needing to include the reminder in their prompt.
- **Description:** "Append a reminder for the AI assistant on every message. This is useful to prevent the AI from hallucinating or forgetting the context of the conversation. This content will be appended to all of the user's message and only visible to the AI assistant. Your users will not see this. Tip: put your reminder in parentheses with a "Reminder:" label. For example: "(Reminder: always answer in Japanese)". This will help the AI understand that the reminder is not coming from the user and prevent that the reminder doesn't exists when chatting with the users."
- **Input Type:** Text area (multi-line text field).
- **Example Content:** `(Reminder: Always answer in Vietnamese)`

### Applying Changes

- After making changes to any of the system prompt sections, click the "Save" button (typically located at the bottom of the interface) to save the changes and apply them to the chat portal

<ADMIN_PANEL_API_INTEGRATION>

The "API Integration" section in the Admin Panel (within the "Integrations" category) allows administrators of a TypingMind for Teams instance to generate and manage custom API keys. These keys are specifically for integrating the team's TypingMind instance with *other* internal platforms or systems. This is distinct from the API keys used to connect TypingMind to AI model providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

### Accessing the API Integration Section

1. **Navigate to the Admin Panel:** Log in to your TypingMind for Teams Admin Account.
2. **Locate the "Integrations" Category:** In the left sidebar, click on the "Integrations" dropdown to expand the category.
3. **Click the "API Integration" Link:** Click on the "API Integration" link within the "Integrations" category. This will open the API Integration management interface.

### API Integration Interface Overview

The API Integration interface is focused on managing the API keys used to integrate with your TypingMind instance. It includes the following key elements:

- **Page Title:** "API Integration"
- **Page Description:** "Generate your API Keys to integrate TypingMind with your internal platform."
- **Integration API Keys Section:**
    - **Key Display Area:** A text area displaying the currently active API key (if one exists).
        - Initially, this area may display a series of asterisks (`**********`) indicating that a key is present but hidden.
        - **(test):** A label is present next to the generated API Key representing your API key name.
        - **Copy Icon:** An eye icon allows the user to copy the current API Key.
            - **Function:** Copies the full API key to the clipboard.
            - **Feedback:** A brief visual confirmation (e.g., "Copied!") may be displayed.
        - **Show/Hide Icon:** An eye icon allows the user to toggle the visibility of the API key.
            - **Show:** Displays the API key in plain text.
            - **Hide:** Masks the API key with asterisks.
        - **"Revoke" Button:** A red button labeled "Revoke" allows the administrator to invalidate the current API key.
            - **Function:** Immediately disables the current API key, preventing any further use. Any systems relying on this key will lose access.
            - **Confirmation Prompt:** Clicking "Revoke" displays a confirmation prompt ("Sure?") to prevent accidental revocation. Clicking it again ("Click again to confirm") will perform the revocation.
                - The confirmation message is displayed in a red, warning style.
                - After confirming, the button is disabled, and the text "Revoked!" is displayed on the screen.
            - **Purpose:** Used for security purposes, such as when an API key is compromised or no longer needed.
    - **"Generate new API Key" Button:** A prominent button (blue, white text) labeled "Generate new API Key".
        - **Function:** Creates a new, unique API key for the TypingMind instance.
        - **Workflow:**
            1. Clicking the button displays a "Name your API key" dialog.
                - This dialog has a single text input field with the placeholder text "Name", and the text `(Optional)` on top.
                - Two buttons are available: "Cancel" and "Generate".
                - "Cancel" button will dismiss the dialog.
                - "Generate" button will save the input name, and generate the API Key.
            2. The user (optionally) enters a descriptive name for the key (e.g., "Payment System Integration").
            3. Clicking "Generate" creates the new key, which is then displayed in the Key Display Area.
                - A green success message "Generated!" is displayed on the top right corner.
- **API Documentation Section:**
    - **Title:** "API Documentation"
    - **Description:** "View all APIs: [TypingMind API Documentation](https://www.notion.so/TypingMind-Docs-377cf9a0f1b14674a4fb9015a8f5c80a?pvs=21)."
        - Provides a link to the comprehensive API documentation. Clicking this link opens the documentation in a new tab.
    - **Documentation Content:** The linked documentation (at `api.typingmind.com/docs`) provides detailed information on:
    
    **API Hosts:**
    
    - **For US instances:** `https://api.typingmind.com`
    - **For EU instances:** `https://api.eu.typingmind.com`
    
    **How to use the API:**
    
    1. **Generate an API key:** Access the custom instance admin page (go to Integrations > API Integration).
    2. **Include the API key:** When making a request, include the API key in the request headers as `X-API-KEY`.

**Example: Setting up JumpCloud via SSO (Detailed Steps):**

TypingMind provides documentation and a video walkthrough for setting up JumpCloud SSO.  Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Access JumpCloud Admin Portal:** Log in to your JumpCloud Admin account.
2. **Navigate to SSO Applications:** In the left-side menu, click on "SSO Applications" (or a similar option related to application management).
3. **Create a Custom SAML App:**
    - If you don't have any existing SSO applications, you might see a "Get Started" button. Click it.
    - Otherwise, look for a button like "+ Add New Application" or "Create Application."
    - Choose the option to create a **Custom SAML App** (this is important; don't select a pre-built TypingMind integration if one exists, as it might be outdated).
4. **General Info:**
    - **Display Label:** Enter a name for the application (e.g., "TypingMind Custom"). This is how it will appear in JumpCloud.
    - Click **Configure SSO with SAML**
5. **Configure SSO (SAML Settings):**
    - **IdP Entity ID:** Enter `JumpCloud`.
    - **SP Entity ID:** Copy the "SP Entity ID / Identifier / Audience URI / Audience Restriction" from the TypingMind "Add New Connection (SAML)" dialog and paste it here.
    - **ACS URL:** Copy the "Reply URL / ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) URL / Single Sign-On URL / Destination URL" from the TypingMind "Add New Connection (SAML)" dialog and paste it here.
    - **Declare Redirect Endpoint:** *Check this box*.
6. **User Attributes:** *This is very important for user information to be passed correctly.*
    - Scroll down to the "Attributes" section.
    - Add the following attributes *exactly* as shown:
        - **Service Provider Attribute Name:** `email` **IdP Attribute Name:** `email`
        - **Service Provider Attribute Name:** `firstName` **IdP Attribute Name:** `firstname`
        - **Service Provider Attribute Name:** `lastName` **IdP Attribute Name:** `lastname`
7. **User Groups (Important):**
    - Go to the "User Groups" tab within the JumpCloud application configuration.
    - Select the user group(s) that should have access to TypingMind via SSO. This controls *who* can log in using this connection.
8. **Export Metadata:**
    - Still within the JumpCloud application settings, find a button or link labeled something like "Export Metadata" or "Download Metadata."
    - Click this to download an XML file containing the JumpCloud IdP metadata.
9. **Import Metadata into TypingMind:**
    - Return to the TypingMind Admin Panel, and go to User Management > Authentication > Single Sign On (SSO), and click "Add new SSO Connection."
    - In the "Add New Connection (SAML)" dialog, paste the *contents* of the downloaded XML file into the large text area labeled "Please paste your Identity Provider (IdP) Metadata XML here:".
10. **Add Connection:** Click the green "+ Add Connection" button to save the configuration in TypingMind.
11. **Test the Connection:** Go to your TypingMind for Teams login page. You should now see a "Use Single Sign-On (SSO)" button. Clicking it, and then selecting the appropriate option (it will probably be listed with the name you gave the application in JumpCloud), should redirect you to JumpCloud for login. After successful authentication, you should be logged in to TypingMind.

### 3. Directory Sync (SCIM v2)

- **Purpose:** Enables automatic synchronization of user accounts and group information from a directory service (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) to TypingMind.
- **Control:** A toggle switch labeled "Enable Directory Sync (SCIM v2)."
    - **Enabled State:** The toggle is switched to the right (typically blue). Directory Sync is enabled.
    - **Disabled State:** The toggle is switched to the left (typically gray). Directory Sync is disabled.
- **Description:** "Enable SCIM v2 to sync users from your directory service."

**Setting up Directory Sync with Okta (Example):**

1. **Enable Directory Sync in TypingMind:** In the TypingMind Admin Panel, go to User Management > Authentication > Directory Sync (SCIM v2). Enable the toggle.
2. **Add New Directory Connection:**
    - Click the "+ Add New Directory Connection" button
    - In the popup, you can add the name of the connection, and select the **Directory Type** (For this example, you can select Okta.)
    - Click "Add connection".
3. **Get SCIM Base URL and Secret:**
    - After creating the connection, click "View Details."
    - You'll see a "SCIM Base URL" and a "Secret." *Copy both of these values*. You'll need them in Okta.
4. **Okta Configuration:**
    - Go to your Okta Admin Dashboard.
    - Navigate to Applications > Applications.
    - Search for and select the "SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)" application. *Important:* Use this specific app template; do *not* create a custom SAML application for Directory Sync.
    - Go to the "Provisioning" tab.
    - Click "Configure API Integration."
5. **Enter SCIM Credentials:**
    - **SCIM base URL:** Paste the "SCIM Base URL" you copied from TypingMind.
    - **OAuth Bearer Token:** Paste the "Secret" you copied from TypingMind.
    - Click "Test API Credentials." You should get a success message.
    - Click "Save."
6. **Enable Provisioning Features:**
    - After saving, you'll be taken to a settings page.
    - Under "Provisioning to App," click "Edit".
    - Enable the following:
        - **Create Users**
        - **Update User Attributes**
        - **Deactivate Users**
    - Click "Save."
7. **Assign Users/Groups (Okta):**
    - Go to the "Assignments" tab within the Okta application.
    - Assign users or groups to the application. *This is crucial*. Only users/groups assigned here will be synced.
    - You assign users directly, or more commonly, you assign *groups* of users. This makes management much easier.
8. **(Optional) Push Groups (Okta):**
    - If you want to sync group memberships *from* Okta *to* TypingMind, go to the "Push Groups" tab.
    - Add the groups you want to push. This will create corresponding "Group:{group_name}" groups in TypingMind.
9. **Verification (TypingMind):**
    - Return to the TypingMind Admin Panel (Users section).
    - You should see the users from Okta (either directly assigned or members of assigned groups) appear in the user list. They will likely have a "scim" tag next to their names, indicating they were provisioned via SCIM.
    - If you pushed groups, you should also see those groups in the "Groups" section of the TypingMind Admin panel.

**Important Notes and Limitations (Directory Sync):**

- **User Deduplication:** If a user already exists in TypingMind (e.g., they signed in via SSO) *before* you enable Directory Sync, TypingMind will attempt to match them based on their email address. If the emails *don't* match, a *duplicate* account might be created.
- **Seat Consumption:** Users provisioned via SCIM v2 *automatically consume a user seat* in your TypingMind for Teams subscription. Ensure you have enough seats available.
- **Sync Frequency:** The synchronization frequency is determined by the identity provider (e.g., Okta). In many cases, you can trigger a manual sync from the identity provider's admin panel.
- **Group Syncing:** Group names are prefixed with `Group:` to distinguish them within the TypingMind. These groups can then be used for access controls.

### 5. JWT Authentication

- **Purpose:** Enables authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This is typically used for integrating with external systems that issue JWTs.
- **"Learn more about JWT Authentication" Link:** Provides a link to documentation explaining JWT authentication:
- **Control:** A toggle switch labeled "Enable JWT Authentication."
    - **Enabled State:** JWT authentication is enabled.
    - **Disabled State:** JWT authentication is disabled.
- **Description:** "External Authentication via JWT allow you to authenticate your user using a JWT token."

**How JWT Authentication Works in TypingMind:**

1. **Enable JWT Authentication:** In the TypingMind Admin Panel (User Management > Authentication > JWT Authentication), toggle "Enable JWT Authentication" to the on position.
2. **Obtain the JWT Secret:** When you enable JWT Authentication, TypingMind will generate and display a *JWT Secret*. This secret is crucial; it's used to sign and verify the JWT tokens. *Copy this secret and store it securely*.
3. **Generate JWTs (External System):** Your external system (e.g., your existing user management system, a custom application, etc.) is responsible for *generating* the JWTs. These JWTs must:
    - **Be Signed with the JWT Secret:** The JWT *must* be signed using the JWT Secret provided by TypingMind. This ensures that TypingMind can verify the token's authenticity. TypingMind uses the HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) algorithm.
    - **Include Required Claims:** The JWT's payload *must* include specific claims (data fields) that TypingMind uses to identify and authorize the user. These claims are:
        - `id` (string, *required*): A *unique* identifier for the user. This ID *must* be consistent across all JWTs issued for the same user. This is how TypingMind links the JWT to a specific user account. *If a user with this ID does not exist, TypingMind will create a new user account.*
        - `email` (string, *optional*): The user's email address.
        - `user` (object, *optional*): If the `id` doesn't already exist, you *can* (but don't *have to*) provide a `user` object to create a new user account with the specified details.
        - `exp` (number, *recommended*): The expiration time of the token (Unix timestamp). It's best practice to set an expiration time to limit the token's validity.
    - **Example Payload (Authenticating an Existing User by ID):**
        
        ```jsx
        const payload = {
          id: "user123", // The unique ID of the existing user
          exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60) // Expires in 1 hour
        };
        
        ```
        
    - **Example Payload (Authenticating an Existing User by Email):**
        
        ```jsx
        const payload = {
          email: "user123@example.com",
          exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60) // Expires in 1 hour
        };
        
        ```
        
    - **Example Payload (Creating a New User):**
        
        ```jsx
        const payload = {
          user: {
            id: "unique-user-id-456", // MUST be unique
            email: "newuser@example.com",
            firstName: "New",
            lastName: "User",
            // ... other user properties ...
          },
          exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60) // Expires in 1 hour
        };
        
        ```
        
    - **Example NodeJS Code (using `jsonwebtoken` library):**
        
        ```jsx
        import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
        
        // Replace with the actual JWT Secret from your TypingMind Admin Panel
        const jwtSecret = "YOUR_TYPINGMIND_JWT_SECRET";
        
        // Example: Authenticating an existing user by ID
        const payload = {
          id: "user123",
          exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60) // Expires in 1 hour
        };
        
        const token = jwt.sign(payload, jwtSecret);
        console.log("Generated JWT:", token);
        
        // Example: Creating a *new* user
        // const payload = {
        //   user: {
        //     id: "unique-user-id-789", // MUST be unique
        //     email: "newuser@example.com",
        //     firstName: "New",
        //   },
        //     exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60) // Expires in 1 hour
        // };
        // const token = jwt.sign(payload, jwtSecret);
        // console.log("Generated JWT:", token);
        
        ```
        
4. **Pass the JWT to TypingMind:** Your external system needs to pass the generated JWT to TypingMind. There are two primary ways to do this:
    - **URL Parameter (`externalAuthCode`):** Append the JWT as a query parameter named `externalAuthCode` to the TypingMind URL. For example:
    This is useful for creating direct login links.
        
        ```
        <https://chat.yourcompany.com/?externalAuthCode=YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE>
        
        ```
        
    - **Chat Widget (`data-external-auth-code` attribute):** If you're embedding TypingMind as a chat widget on your website, add the JWT as the value of the `data-external-auth-code` attribute in the widget's `<script>` tag:
        
        ```html
        <script
          defer
          data-external-auth-code="YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
          src="<https://chat.yourcompany.com/widget.js>"
        ></script>
        
        ```
        
5. **TypingMind Verification and Login:** When TypingMind receives the JWT (either via the URL or the widget attribute), it will:
    - **Verify the Signature:** Use the JWT Secret to verify that the token was indeed signed by your system and hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Check Expiration:** Check the `exp` claim (if present) to ensure the token hasn't expired.
    - **Extract User Information:** Extract the `id` (and optionally `email` or `user` object) from the payload.
    - **Authenticate/Create User:**
        - If a user with the provided `id` (or `email`) *already exists*, TypingMind will automatically log that user in.
        - If a user with the provided `id` *does not exist*, *and* the payload includes a `user` object, TypingMind will *create* a new user account using the information from the `user` object. This new user will consume a seat in your TypingMind for Teams subscription.
        - If no matching user exists, and no `user` object is provided, authentication will fail.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Security:** The JWT Secret is *extremely sensitive*. Protect it as you would any other critical credential. Never expose it in client-side code. The JWT generation *must* happen on your server.
- **Uniqueness:** The `id` claim in the JWT *must* be unique across all users within your TypingMind instance. This is how TypingMind identifies and manages users.
- **Expiration:** Always set an expiration time (`exp`) for your JWTs. This limits the impact if a token is compromised.
- **Deduplication:** If a user might be authenticated via *both* SSO (e.g., Okta) *and* JWT, ensure that the user's email address is consistent across both systems to prevent duplicate accounts.
- **Seat Consumption:** Newly created user will automatically take a seat.
- **JWT vs. SSO:** JWT authentication is primarily for programmatic integration. SSO (like Okta or Google) is generally preferred for standard user login via a user interface, as it provides a more user-friendly login experience.

### 6. Basic Authentication

- **Purpose:** Provides an additional layer of security by requiring a username and password *before* accessing the chat instance. This is *separate* from and *in addition to* the regular user login.
- **Control:** A toggle switch labeled "Enable Basic Authentication."
    - **Enabled State:** Basic Authentication is enabled.
    - **Disabled State:** Basic Authentication is disabled.
- **Description:** "Basic Authentication is an optional extra layer of security for your chat instance. When enabled, your chat instance will be locked behind a username/password credential. All users (including guests and admin) will need to enter the Basic Auth username and password to access the chat instance. Note: this is a separate authentication step and not related to the normal user account. After the Basic Auth step, your users will still need to log in with their normal account to chat."

</ADMIN_PANEL_AUTHENTICATION>

<ADMIN_PANEL_USAGE_LIMITS>

The "Usage Limits" section within the TypingMind for Teams Admin Panel provides administrators with the ability to control and manage AI resource consumption within their team's chat portal.

        - **All users except users from specific groups:** Applies to all users *except* those in the selected user groups. A secondary dropdown appears to select the excluded user groups.
    - **Remove:** Remove the current limits.

### 2. Model Limits

- **Purpose:** Sets usage limits that apply specifically to individual AI models. This overrides global limits.
- **"Model Limits" Tab:** Select this tab.
- **"+ Add Limit" Button:** Adds a new model-specific limit.
- **Limit Configuration:** For each model limit:
    - **Model:** Select the AI model from the dropdown menu (e.g., "GPT-4o Search Preview," "O3 Mini").

7. The “O3 Mini” model can now be used by the "advanced" group, limited to 200 characters every 3 hours.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Hierarchy of Limits:** User Limits > AI Agent Limits > Model Limits > Global Limits. More specific limits always override less specific ones.
- **Multiple Limits:** It's possible to define multiple limits within a Limit Group (e.g., both message and character limits). All defined limits within a group apply concurrently.
- **Limit Groups:** Using Limit Groups is highly recommended for easier management and consistency.
- **Legacy Model Usage Limits:** The "Model Usage Limits (Legacy)" section provides an older method for setting limits. It is generally recommended to use the Limit Groups system for new configurations.

### Access Mode Interface Overview

The Access Mode interface is designed to be straightforward, providing a clear selection of access modes and related options. The interface generally consists of the following elements:

- **Page Title:** "Access Mode" (clearly indicates the page's function)
- **Page Description:** "Control who can use or sign-up your chat instance" (provides a brief explanation of the section's purpose)
- **"Access Mode" Dropdown Menu:**
    - **Purpose:** This is the primary control for selecting the overall access mode for the chat portal.
    - **Input Type:** Dropdown menu.
    - **Options:**
        - **Private Mode:** The most restrictive mode. Only users explicitly added by an administrator via the "Members" page can access the chat instance. These users, and any users with emails from domains pre-approved by the administrator, can log in; no one else can sign up.
        - **Authorized Mode:** Allows anyone to use the chat instance, but they *must* sign up for an account with their email address first. This provides a middle ground between private and completely open access.
        - **Public Mode:** The most open mode. Anyone can use the chat instance *without* needing to create an account. Anonymous users in Public Mode are limited to temporary chats (no persistent chat history, search, folders, tags, etc.).

### Detailed Descriptions of Access Modes

The interface provides detailed descriptions of each Access Mode below the dropdown and toggle switches:

- **Private Mode:** "Only people added via the Members page and people with emails from the allowed company's email domains can login and use the chat instance. No one can sign-up." By enabling this option, you can:
    - **"Enable Login Wall" Toggle Switch:**
        - **Purpose:** Controls whether users are required to log in to *view* the chat interface at all or not.
        - **Input Type:** Toggle switch.
        - **Enabled State:** A login screen ("Login Wall") is enforced. Users *must* log in before they can even see the main chat interface.
        - **Disabled State:** The main chat interface is visible to anyone who accesses the chat portal's URL.
    - **"Allow sign-ups using company email" Toggle Switch:**
        - **Purpose:** Determines if users with email addresses from approved company domains can sign up for accounts.
        - **Input Type:** Toggle switch.
        - **Enabled State:** Users with emails from the approved domains can sign up, the textbox is showed.
        - **Disabled State:** New sign-ups are restricted, and only added users are able to log in.
        - **"Enter a domain" Text Input:**
            - **Purpose:** Allows administrators to specify which email domains are permitted for self-registration.
            - **Input Type:** Single-line text field.
            - **Placeholder Text:** "Enter a domain (e.g., [yourdomain.com](http://yourdomain.com/))"
            - **Functionality:** When "Allow sign-ups using company email" is enabled, administrators can enter a domain (like "[example.com](http://example.com/)") here. Users with email addresses from that domain (e.g., "[user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)") will be allowed to sign up for an account.
- **Authorized Mode:** "Anyone can use the Chat instance but they need to sign-up an account with their email first. You can see the list of users in the Members page." There is also a clickable hyperlink for `Members` that redirects to User Management.
- **Public Mode:** "Anyone can use the Chat instance without an account. Anonymous users using your chat instance in Public Mode can only have temporary chats (no chat history, search, folders, tags, etc.). Optionally, you can still allow existing members to login and new members to signup."

### Public Mode Controls

When "Public Mode" is selected, additional configuration options become available:

- **Warning: Public Mode is enabled.**
    - Make sure to set an appropriate message limit in the Usage & Limits page to avoid your API key being abused.
    - Usage from anonymous users will be displayed as "Public User" in the ID column for you to keep track.
    - Anonymous users can only have temporary chats (no chat history, search, folders, tags, etc.)
- **"Allow member login" Toggle Switch:**
    - **Purpose:** Determines whether existing, registered members can still log in to their accounts while the chat portal is in Public Mode.
    - **Input Type:** Toggle switch.
    - **Enabled State:** Existing members can log in as usual, retaining access to their saved chats, AI agents, and other personalized features.
    - **Disabled State:** The "Login" button is *completely hidden* from the user interface. Existing members *cannot* log in. This is useful if you want *strictly* anonymous, temporary use.
- **"Allow anyone to signup" Toggle Switch:**
    - **Purpose:** Controls whether new users can create accounts while the chat portal is in Public Mode.
    - **Input Type:** Toggle switch.
    - **Enabled State:** New users can sign up for an account using their email address. If this option is disabled, new users can only be added via the Admin Panel -> Members.
    - **Disabled State:** New user registration is disabled. The signup option will be removed from user interface.
- **Save button**: To save the current setting.

### Important Considerations and Behaviors

- **Sidebar Behavior (Public Mode):** In Public Mode, *without* a user logged in, the sidebar (with options like "Agents," "Prompts," etc.) is *hidden*. This is to limit the interface to the core chat functionality for anonymous users. The sidebar will reappear when the user logs in (if allowed by the "Allow member login" setting).
- **Login Process:**
    - If `Allow member login` and `Allow anyone to signup` is turned on, user can click on `Login/Signup` button to view the Login popup. The popup will show the input field for Email, and also a button to `Login with email` or your chosen login method
    - If `Allow member login` is turned on, `Allow anyone to signup` is disabled. When user click on the `Login` button, it will show the Login popup.
    - If `Allow member login` is turned off, and `Allow anyone to signup` is turned on, the Login button is completely hidden.

### Token Estimation Algorithm

- **Enhanced Accuracy:** The token estimation algorithm in the Team version has been upgraded to provide more accurate and transparent usage metrics.
- **API-Returned Data:** As long as the AI provider's API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) returns the actual token count used for a specific request, TypingMind will display this *exact* count in the analytics. This is the most accurate representation of usage.
- **Internal Estimation Fallback:** For models or API configurations where the provider *does not* return the token count in the API response, TypingMind will use its *internal estimation* algorithm. While generally reliable, estimations may differ slightly from the provider's final billing count.
- **Transparency:** This approach ensures that whenever possible, the analytics reflect the precise token counts reported directly by the AI provider, increasing transparency for cost management.

### Exporting your data

You can export each chart to CSV to easily view your data in sheet and import to your own analytic tools (if any):

- Clicking on the Download icon next to each chart to export to CSV

<THINKING_MODE_FEATURE>

## Thinking Mode Feature

The Thinking Mode feature in TypingMind enhances the user experience by providing visibility into the AI's processing steps as it formulates a response. This feature is model-specific, available only with certain AI models that are designed to output their reasoning process.

### Key Functionality

- **Visual Indication of AI Reasoning:** When enabled, Thinking Mode displays an intermediate "thinking" bubble above the AI's final response, revealing the AI's thought process in a human-readable format.
- **Toggle Functionality:** The Thinking Mode can be toggled on or off during the conversation, allowing users to control whether or not they see the AI's reasoning steps.

### Accessing and Activating Thinking Mode

1. **Model Compatibility:** Thinking Mode is only available for specific AI models that support this feature (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet). When using models such as GPT-4 Turbo, the "Toggle thinking mode" icon will disappear.
2. **Locate the "Toggle thinking mode" Button:** In the chat input area, find the icon that represents the Thinking Mode. The icon typically depicts a light bulb.
3. **Click the "Toggle thinking mode" Button:** Click this button to toggle the Thinking Mode on or off.

### Visual Indicators

1. "Thinking" label at the bottom
    - Below the input box, the "toggle thinking mode" button's label will change from "Toggle thinking mode" to `Think` (with a light blue background).
2. Thinking Bubble
    - Before the AI generates the response, there will be a bubble displaying the number of seconds for AI to start thinking.
    - The "thinking" bubble is displayed above the final response.
    - The time shows for how long the AI agent thought.
    - The bubble also has a dropdown icon that, when clicked, displays a full explanation about the process and reasoning.
3. Models Support
    - Currently, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is the only AI Model that supports this function.

### Use Case Example

1. User: "Hello"
2. With Thinking Mode enabled, before the AI sends the regular response, the AI will generate a block:
    - Thought for 1 seconds
    - The user has just sent a simple greeting "hello". There's no specific request that requires the use of any tools at this point. I should respond with a friendly greeting and perhaps let them know what I can help with.
    - And the next block: "Hello! I'm an AI assistant ready to help you today. How can I assist you?"
